### Save editor for the game Xenonauts

Currently allows only to change the statistics of soldiers (both recruited and available for recruitment)  
I don't provide the binaries at this time, the project can be easily built using Visual Studio  
Will only work on Windows due to using Windows Forms  

Known bugs:  
- Current HP of a soldier doesn't get updated when the Maximum HP is changed  

Code needs a lot of cleaning and commenting - which might, or might not, happen at some point in the future
